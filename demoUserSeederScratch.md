    body: "Julie was driving, we were listening to a book on tape, I can't remember what, but I really zoned out and then fell asleep with my arm leaned against the window. It was not a comfortable position. 
    I don't really remember how long I was asleep, but when I woke up, my right arm was completely fried; it had been sitting in the sun and I didn't have any sunscreen on for obvious reasons and I was red like a lobster. I'd been wearing sunglasses, and my face right around my right eye had a glasses outline where everything outside of my glasses was red as well.
    Not going to lie, it was one of the worse pains I'd felt, and it kind of ruined the trip. I definitely learned to consider the sun in future car trips. Pretty sure up until then I just thought that if I was in the car then I didn't have to worry about sunlight exposure. I never made that mistake again though.",
