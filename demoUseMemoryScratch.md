    body: `Julie was driving, we were listening to a book on tape, I can't remember what, but I really zoned out and then fell asleep with my arm leaned against the window. It was not a comfortable position. 
    I don't really remember how long I was asleep, but when I woke up, my right arm was completely fried; it had been sitting in the sun and I didn't have any sunscreen on for obvious reasons and I was red like a lobster. I'd been wearing sunglasses, and my face right around my right eye had a glasses outline where everything outside of my glasses was red as well.
    Not going to lie, it was one of the worse pains I'd felt, and it kind of ruined the trip. I definitely learned to consider the sun in future car trips. Pretty sure up until then I just thought that if I was in the car then I didn't have to worry about sunlight exposure. I never made that mistake again though.`,

    body: `This is a funny story. I was choir president and me and Patrick were doing some choreography for the Spring choir concert. Most of the class was sitting in the audience while we were on stage showing them the dance moves. The auditorium seats were about eye level with the stage, depending on where you were sitting, and I did this knee slide move straight to the front of the stage, and right then my pants ripped right up the crotch.
    Everyone burst out laughing. I was embarrassed but it really wasn't that bad, mostly funny. Choir was toward the beginning of the day, so I got permission to drive home and change my pants before I continued on with the rest of the day. 
    I don't recall all that well but I think our choir concert was a great hit that year.`,

    body: `Not a lot to remember except that there was a huge blizzard in '96 and we got tons of school off, and I recall creating this massive igloo (massive in respect to my young self) and sleeping inside of it, and my mom brought me out hot chocolate and it was fine that I just wanted to curl up and stay inside this quiet little snow shelter. 
    As an adult I wonder what I would think about a kid who did the same. Were they lonely? Did they just like the quiet?`,

    body: `Julie had a family friend that kept Corgis on their farm. When they had puppies, Julie and I were invited to go play, and it's one of my best memories. We rolled around with those puppies for so long while their mom and dad watched on proudly, and it was so fun!
    We were not allowed to have a dog per our current lease, but we ended up getting Arwyn anyway because we just fell in love. And Arwyn really was an amazing dog; so friendly and caring and interested, but also grouchy in an endearing way.
    We had to wait two weeks for her to get some shots she needed before she could come home with us, but I remember the car ride as I drove us home and Arwyn sat in Julie's lap just looking around, having no idea where she was going or where her family was. She was scared, but Julie and I just loved her, and soon we became a nice little family.
    Weird memory to recollect so fondly even though they aren't a part of my life anymore...`,
